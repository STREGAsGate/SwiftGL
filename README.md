An OpenGL Core Profile binding for Swift

This package is intended as a package dependant for UniversalGraphics, however it works great by itself so it's seperated and available here.
macOS and Linux (as GLX) are tested and working. Other platforms are not currently tested and may not be fully implemented.

Being platform feature complete is not a goal for this package. The goal is to support Linux. macOS is also fully implemented to make development eaiser.

Adding support for other platforms is not difficult. Pull-Requests are welcome.
